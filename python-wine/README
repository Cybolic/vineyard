python-wine allows you to configure Wine through Python.

For example, to set the default version of Windows to emulate, you can call:
	wine.version.set('win2k')
or to set the default version for a program, you could call:
	wine.version.set('win2k', 'notepad.exe')

python-wine also contains functions for more advanced usage, like getting icons
for programs. An example could be:
	wine.programs.list()['WinRAR archiver']['programicon']
python-wine will scan both the Windows registry and the XDG menu paths for
information and cross-reference it for you.

With the exception of theme support, python-wine supports everything that
winecfg does and tries to do its operations in a compatible way.

The library has been developed for use in Vineyard available at
https://launchpad.net/vineyard but will work just fine for other uses.

At the moment there is no documentation, but the library should be fairly
intuitive to use, and if not, feel free to contact me at <cybolic@gmail.com>
