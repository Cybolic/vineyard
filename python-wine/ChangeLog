Version 0.3

2009-25-08 Christan Dannie Storgaard <cybolic@gmail.com>

	* Many, many parts rewritten.
	* Many, many bugs fixed.
	* Converted all modules, except _cache, to not use classes.
	* Renamed most functions to standard Python naming (underlines instead of
	  CamelCase).
	* Program listing from reg now lists duplicate program names the same as
	  Nautilus ("name", "name (1)", ...).
	* Wine programs used internally are now run without a valid DISPLAY
	  variable, to get rid of Wine's internal update dialog.
	* run() arguments that start with 'CDROM:\' are now automatically converted
	  to the drive letter for any Wine defined or mounted CD drive that contain
	  the requested file - the CD drive that contains the file will be added to
	  to configurations list of drives if it not already.
	* run() now returns a wine.monitor.Program instance instead of a Popen
	  instance.
	* wine.monitor is added and contains a list of running programs and has the
	  ability to read log files of current and previously run programs along
	  with providing explanations for common Wine errors.
	  (wine.monitor.Program.explain_errors())
	* wine.command is added as a replacement for direct use of subprocess.Popen.
	  This works around issues with output buffering (e.g. the AvP3 installer)
	  as well as issues with zombie processes.
	* wine.registry.get() will now try a simple parsing of the .reg files to
	  produce faster output that is limited to a branch depth level of 2.
	  If there are more levels in the requested branch, the standard code will
	  be used.
	* wine.drives.add() now supports a 'type' argument.

Version 0.2.5.6

2009-03-15 Christian Dannie Storgaard <cybolic@gmail.com>

	* Improved wine.util.wintounix to better handle '~' like the shell handles '*'.
	* Added wine.util.unixtowin.
	* Added wine.appearance that so far handles theme functions, other functions
	  might migrate here in the future.
	* Added wine.appdb to query and forward the user to WineHQ's AppDB.

Version 0.2.5.5

2009-03-14 Christian Dannie Storgaard <cybolic@gmail.com>

	* Fixed an error that occured if ~/.wine didn't exist.
	* Fixed an error with setting shell folders when using a non-English locale,
	  thanks to Tiago J. Pavan for reporting it.
	* Turned off Wine's fixme messages.

Version 0.2.5.4

2009-03-02 Christian Dannie Storgaard <cybolic@gmail.com>

	* Restructured wine.run(), added support for opening directories and fixed
	  some errors in it.
	* Rewrote registry program to menu entry matching and improved the
	  matching.
	* Added support for not splitting variable definitions in
	  wine.util.splitString().

Version 0.2.5.3

2009-02-22 Christian Dannie Storgaard <cybolic@gmail.com>

	* New function, wine.drives.getMainDrive().
	* Much improved programs and program override support.

Version 0.2.5.2

2009-02-22 Christian Dannie Storgaard <cybolic@gmail.com>

	* Fixed a bug that occured with programs names that have unbalanced
	  parentheses, thanks to Andy Piper for reporting this.

Version 0.2.5.1

2009-02-20 Christian Dannie Storgaard <cybolic@gmail.com>

	* Added missing parsers.py file that cause python-wine to not work at all.

Version 0.2.5

2009-02-18 Christian Dannie Storgaard <cybolic@gmail.com>

	* Rewrote registry file parser, doesn't fall over any more and is faster.
	* Added new function to wine.programs, setProgramOptions to update the
	  info of a program.
	* Fixed some bugs in program listing related to the introduction of
	  the new Vineyard-prefixed entries in the registry (the overriding
	  variables, see last changelog).

Version 0.2.4

	* util.wintounix now supports '~' characters for fuzzy matching.
	* Program finding and listing functions completely rewritten, they
	  are now more intelligent, more coherent and easier to maintain.
	  Note that the new functions produce slightly different output than
	  the old, f.x. program name are now stripped of version info, which
	  is now listed as version info.
	* Program finding now also lists menu entries that do not have a match
	  in the registry.
	* Icons for programs are now created and maintained internally which
	  gives a pretty significant speed boost.
	* Icons are now created by directly calling wrestool and icotool
	  instead of using gnome-exe-thumbnailer, dropping the dependancy.
	* Registry values are now parsed much better and supports extended
	  strings and multi-strings.
	* Hex conversion is now simpler and more stable.
	* Added list of known library (DLL) packages (like Visual Basic and WMP).
	* Added wine.icons that so far only has one function: convert, which will
	  return either the original filename of an icon or the matching mime type
	  icon name. Other icon functions will be moved here later.
	* Added functions for overriding registry information for programs.

Version 0.2.3

	* Fixed an error that allowed a bottle without a name to be created.
	* Fixed creating a bottle if no winebottles directory exists.
	* Adding a new bottle now returns True or False indicating if the creation
	  was successful.
	* Trying to remove a non-existing bottle now doesn't exit Python.
	* Adding a new bottle now waits until Wine dir creation is finished before
	  cleaning up shellfolders.

	* Cleaned up the use of 'icon' and 'programicon' in program listings.
	  'icon' is now used for when a graphics file can be loaded for an icon.
	  'programicon' is used for when an icon has to be extraced from an exe file.
	* Program listings now also use the registry key 'DisplayIcon' for finding icons.
